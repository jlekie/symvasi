Symvasi is a cross-platform code generation framework designed to provide seamless service implementations between components
defined in multiple different environments.

number of different languages.
- **Runtimes** - In addition to the generate code provided by the code generation engine Symvasi also provides multiple standardized
runtimes for different languages that integrate with the generated code.
